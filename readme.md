![Snake](https://github.com/NishitSingh2023/SNAKE/blob/master/snakepic.png)
**Everyone knows about the Infamous `SNAKE` game this is my version of the game in `PYTHON`** 
***
 This snake game uses the **Turtle** library to work and visualize the snake board

The snake is **controlled** by the `arrow keys` and the goal is same as always get as many food as possible **avoiding** the `boundaries` and the `snake itself`

> PS:- I haven't made the complete game myself bits of code are take from the net
